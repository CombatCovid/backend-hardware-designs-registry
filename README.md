# backend-hardware-designs-registry
Similar to npm or yarn we want to have a registry of repositories with all the documentation and file downloads ready to use to replicate designs

## Guidelines
- Use git flow. Just do `git flow init`. This way we can work on specific features and have a good product backlog.
- Use SCRUM with product backlog
- Ideally lets plan a sprint after we have a decent product backlog
